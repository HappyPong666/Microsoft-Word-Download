Payloads:
When the virus is executed, it will show a message saying:
"fukpong.exe is not a valid Win32 application!"
If OK is pressed or the message is closed, it will wait 20 seconds then it will show its payloads. If the user end the
process (mshta.exe, HappyPong.exe) in the Task Manager before running, the virus will not show its payloads after 20
seconds.
After 20 seconds, it will restart File Explorer, then terminate mutiple programs like Task Manager. Then it will:
Create a .txt file in its location named "note.txt". The TXT file looks like an email. But it's not.
Create a hidden folder named "HappyPong" in C:\WINDOWS. The folder cannot be shown by Folder Options because it is hidden
by the Command Prompt (attrib command)
Create VBS, BAT, MP3 and HTA files in the HappyPong folder
Execute some files in the HappyPong folder
Then it will disable some programs (Task Manager, Control Panel, Run, Command Prompt - allowing batch files to run,...)
It also disables features like Aero Peek and most used apps in the Start Menu.
It also changes AM or PM to "HAPPY"
It also changes the Taskbar color
It also changes the search box text to "YOUR_COMPUTER_HAS_BEEN_TRASHED!" (only on Windows 10)
It also creates a bunch of user named "LOVEYOU(random number)"
It also block DeviantArt. The user cannot open DeviantArt. If DeviantArt is opened, it will show a localhost message
Then it changes the default Internet Explorer page to an image of a Backrooms Entity from the video "The Backrooms -
Found Footage"
After 3 seconds, it opens a website with an image of red and orange balls fighting a robot monster (on my profile picture)
with text saying:
"Hello! Welcome to the happy pong game! Hope you like it!"
After 7 seconds, it will open a Scratch project (the pong game), a remaked version of dixiklo's.
Then it opens a VBS speaking:
"Hello! Welcome to happy pong game! Hope you like it!"
The voice forgot the "the" word.
After 5 seconds, it speask:
"Hey, why are not you answering?"
After another 5 seconds, it speaks:
"OK. I know you cannot speak to me. But now I will play some good music. Sound amazing?"
After a few seconds, it disables Desktop icons, network connections and Registry Editor and it change the lock screen background to an SCP-173 image. It plays a Windows 7 Error Remix music on the background. It also change the username to "LOVEYOU". It also change the background to my profile picture (ugly, right?)
After 60 seconds, it shows a red screen. Then it speaks:
"A problem has been detected and windows has been suspended for the rest of your life!"
And a funny thing is... Every 60 seconds, it shows a red screen then it speaks. It does this eight times (for 8
minutes)
After 9 or 10 minutes, it terminates File Explorer, then it shows a message saying:
"Thank you for playing my game! But you are tricked! You cannot get your computer back! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!
PREPARE FOR A SHUTDOWN BATTLE!!!!!"
Then it speaks:
"Hey! I am super happy to tell you that your computer has been trashed by HappyPong! Malware Bytes will not help you!
You just recieved a fake email from Daniel! Hehe get scammed noob!"
After 10 seconds, it will shut down the computer.
If the computer is turned on, the user will see a logon message saying:
"GET_READY_TO_BE_KISSED!"
"I_ALWAYS_LOVE_YOU!!!_PRESS_OK_AND_ENTER_YOUR_PASSWORD_TO_BE_KISSED_MY_FRIEND!!!_ILOVEYOU!!!_SOS!!!1"
After OK is pressed and their password is entered, the computer will shut down.
Please note that the computer will shut down every time when the user boot to their desktop and a message saying:
"SHUTDOWN BATTLE STARTING... FOREVER!" with no title
Safe Mode will be useless because there is no power options.

Easter Eggs:
There is a funny thing in this virus. If the user have Outlook then the virus will send an image from Alear TG TF by Gaminglover on DeviantArt.
