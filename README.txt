Payloads:
When the virus is executed, it will hide itself, and show a message saying:
"fukpong.exe is not a valid Win32 application!"
If OK is pressed or the message is closed, it will wait 30 seconds then it will show its payloads. If the user end the
process (mshta.exe, HappyPong.exe, PING.exe) in the Task Manager before running, the virus will not show its payloads after 30
seconds.
But if the HappyPong folder in WINDOWS directory is exist. The virus will not start, instead, it will show a message from Windows XP saying thatthe application failed to "smile" properly. Clicking OK will reshow itself and will not start itself until when the user
start the virus, the HappyPong folder in C:\WINDOWS is deleted
After 30 seconds, it will restart File Explorer, then terminate mutiple programs like Task Manager. Then it will:
Stop MEMZ Destructive and MEMZ Clean from running.
Create a .txt file in its location named "note.txt". The TXT file looks like an email. But it's not.
Create a hidden folder named "HappyPong" in C:\WINDOWS. The folder cannot be shown by Folder Options because it is hidden
by the Command Prompt (attrib command)
Create VBS, BAT, MP3, JPG, and HTA files in the HappyPong folder
Execute some files in the HappyPong folder
Then it will disable some programs (Task Manager, Control Panel, Run, Command Prompt - allowing batch files to run,...)
It also disables features like Aero Peek and most used apps in the Start Menu.
It also changes all files in the .exe file's location to .vbs (VMware files, VirtualBox files, Scratch files, bat and cmd files, HTML files, image files, system files and more)
It also disables accessing to drives (including hide drives)
It also changes AM or PM to "HAPPY"
It also changes the Taskbar color
It also disables the Windows Defender (only on supported OSes)
It also changes the search box text to "YOUR_COMPUTER_HAS_BEEN_TRASHED!" (only on Windows 10)
Then it changes the default Internet Explorer page to an image of a Backrooms Entity from the video "The Backrooms -
Found Footage"
After 3 seconds, it opens a website with an image of red and orange balls fighting a robot monster (on my profile picture)
with text saying:
"Hello! Welcome to the happy pong game! Hope you like it!"
After 7 seconds, it will open a Scratch project (the pong game), a remaked version of dixiklo's.
Then it opens a VBS speaking:
"Hello! Welcome to happy pong game! Hope you like it!"
The voice forgot the "the" word.
After 5 seconds, it speask:
"Hey, why are not you answering?"
After another 5 seconds, it speaks:
"OK. I know you cannot speak to me. But now I will play some good music. Sound amazing?"
After a few seconds, it disables Desktop icons, network connections and Registry Editor and it change the lock screen background to an SCP-173 image (this payload may not work). It plays a Windows 7 Error Remix music on the background. It also change the username to "LOVEYOU". It also change the background to my profile picture (ugly, right?)
After 60 seconds, it shows a red screen. Then it speaks:
"A problem has been detected and windows has been suspended for the rest of your life!"
And a funny thing is... Every 60 seconds, it shows a red screen then it speaks. It does this eight times (for 8
minutes)
After 9 or 10 minutes, it terminates File Explorer, then it shows a message saying:
"Thank you for playing my game! But you are tricked! You cannot get your computer back! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!
PREPARE FOR A SHUTDOWN BATTLE!!!!!"
Then it speaks:
"Hey! I am super happy to tell you that your computer has been trashed by HappyPong! Malware Bytes will not help you!
You just recieved a fake email from Daniel! Hehe get scammed noob!"
After 10 seconds, it will shut down the computer.
If the computer is turned on, the user will see a logon message saying:
"GET_READY_TO_BE_KISSED!"
"I_ALWAYS_LOVE_YOU!!!_PRESS_OK_AND_ENTER_YOUR_PASSWORD_TO_BE_KISSED_MY_FRIEND!!!_ILOVEYOU!!!_SOS!!!1"
After OK is pressed and their password is entered, the computer will shut down.
Before the computer shut down, it will use NoEscape.exe's payload. It will change click to right click, right click to click
(Swapping Mouse Buttons)
Please note that the computer will shut down every time when the user boot to their desktop and a message saying:
"SHUTDOWN BATTLE STARTING... FOREVER!" with no title
Safe Mode will be useless because there is no power options.
